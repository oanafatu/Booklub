# Bookclub - our mob final project at SALT. 

Check it out here: https://booklub-client.herokuapp.com

The requirements for the final 2 weeks projects were, as following: 
• Must be full stack
• Must use React/Vue & Node
• Must persist some data in a database
• Must work and be demoable at end of each week
• Ensure that it's easy to get from Git
• Must work in strict mob, so that all of you have touched all parts of the project. No splitting up!

Our mob has 4 members:
- Oana Fatu (https://github.com/oanafatu)
- Andrea Gylling (https://github.com/andreagylling)
- László Bottlik (https://github.com/dadinho)
- Nils Andersson (https://github.com/karlnilsthure)

Among the technologies we used:
- React, styled components and some other libraries for the front end
- REST API with express for the backend 
- Postgres as relational database
- implemented google authentication for managing login in the app

We worked Scrum: 
- we wrote user stories ('As a user I want to .. so that ..)
- we estimated user stories using relative estimation
- we started with a sprint 0 were we set up the environment: database structure and fake data (build up a migration script), basic express server set up & npx create react app
- we planned sprint 1 by prioritizing the user stories
- we developed based on the sprint backlog, adding new user stories to the product backlog on the way, as we found them out
- we did a demo after first week, a working app with basic functionalities
- we did a planning for sprint 2 out of the product backlog, we had to prioritize again so that we have a fully working app by the end of the week. And we made it!
